      I am a highly analytical and process-oriented data scientist with proven experience in Python, Excel, and SQL for data extraction, 
      cleaning, and analysis to generate effective and actionable business insights.
      I’m currently completing a Data Science intensive course. With 15 years of experience in business intelligence, I'm excited about 
      combining that experience and data science to find creative solutions to problems and determine the optimal use of organizational data.
      Technical Skills:
        • Languages: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy), Advanced Excel.
        • Databases: SQL (Window Functions, Complex Joins, Nested Queries), My SQL, DB2, SQLite, No SQL.
        • Data Visualization: Jupiter, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI, Google Studio.
        • Data Science Methods: Data Mining, Wrangling, Cleaning, Analysis, Visualization, Storytelling.
        • Predictive Modeling: Linear/Logistic Regression, Classification, Clustering, Random Forest
        • Machine Learning: Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Image Processing, NLP, Spark, keras, TensorFlow
        • Probability and Statistics: Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing
        • Tools: APIs, MS Office (incl. Excel)
      Recently I had the opportunity to collaborate with a small-sized startup where I helped to update their data sources to improve their 
      collection processes. Which ultimately allowed them to have clearer data reporting. It felt amazing to apply the real practical skills that
      I’m learning into a role that would contribute to more profits and a thriving company. I love the idea of helping a company make data-powered 
      decisions. Now I am on a journey to help the next business reach its values and goals.
